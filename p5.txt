turnin code:  sdd_p5


Write a PROLOG program that provides the same functionality as p4, i.e. determines
satisfiability for a set of propositional clauses.
It must run with swipl prolog on system64.

Since prolog itself may produce some output, we will make a small addition to the
output produced by your program.  Instead of printing this:

    1   0
    3   0
    2   1

your program should print this:

    assignment   1   0
    assignment   3   0
    assignment   2   1

That way, a sat-checker program can simply search for lines beginning with the
word assignment, and extract the relevant information.  Please be sure that
your program spells the word assignment correctly, else the checker will not 
give you credit for the output.  In the case of unsatisfiability, you still print:

    UNSATISFIABLE

There are a variety of built-ins for printing (write, display, print).  This line
demos how you might print an assignment in swipl:

    X = 3, Y = 1, write("  assignment "), write(X), write("  "), write(Y), nl.

There is also a change to the input.
The input clauses will not be in a file of DIMACS format; see below.


I will run your program by renaming it to P5.pl  and  running it like this:

    swipl < P5IN1

where P5IN1 is a test file that will load your program and run a predicate
named  sat_with_print  which your program will define in it.  The contents
of the test file would be something like this:

    consult('P5').

    sat_with_print( [
        [ 1, 2],
        [ 2, 3],
        [-2, 3],
        [-2,-3]
    ] ), !.

Note that your program *MUST* contain a predicate named  sat_with_print  that has
the above signature, i.e. takes one argument which is the set of clauses to check
for satisfiability.  

Note that the input clauses will be contained as a list of lists in that file
and NOT in a separate file of DIMACS format.


Use turnin to submit just your prolog program, i.e. *not* a tar file.

Your program will be tested by copying it to a file named P5.pl and running it
in the manner described above.
